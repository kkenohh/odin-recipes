# Introduction to odin-recipes

My personal goal for this project is to practice using Git and Command Line. I learned the basics of HTML on freeCodeCamp so this will be review. I also want to figure out a good workflow for myself so I know how to start my own personal projects. This is a goal I have for The Odin Project as a whole.
