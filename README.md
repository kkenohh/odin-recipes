# Introduction to odin-recipes

My personal goal for this project is to practice using Git and Command Line. I learned the basics of HTML on freeCodeCamp so this will be review. I also want to figure out a good workflow for myself so I know how to start my own personal projects. This is a goal I have for The Odin Project as a whole.

# Reflection

I didn't make the recipes super specific, but this project helped me learn how to structure HTML first and have a layout in mind. Before this, I had learned HTML and CSS together so I was thinking of how to do both, but I think it's better to figure out what goes on the page first before deciding on how you want the page to look. I got a little better at using the Command Line since I used it the whole time for creating files, renaming, and deleting. I feel that I have established a better understanding of the project structure and where to start.
